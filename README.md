# aircraft_dynamics

This repository contains files which apply mathematical theory to fixed wing aircraft in order to analyze their performance,
dynamics, and stability characteristics. Note that all MATLAB files with that end in _script are scripts that will run on 
their own, while all other .m files are functions that must be called.

Mainly the culmination of the work I've done for my Aircraft Dynamics and Controls course, with applications for the plane I helped design and build for my senior research project.
